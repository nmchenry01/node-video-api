# Node-Video-API

The purpose of this repository is to provide a super simple API for use with a frontend web UI. At the current moment it does two things, returns all the contents of an S3 bucket and generates a pre-signed URL for access to the objects for authorized users. This API will be implemented with a series of Lambda functions behind AWS API Gateway. More documentation to come.
